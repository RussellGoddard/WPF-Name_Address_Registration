# WPF-Name_Address_Registration
This app requires a user to input their first and last name and then assigns them a unique ID#. Any additional information entered is also saved. All data can be updated (everything is tied to the ID#)

For more information on how the program works, check the repository wiki or you can browse the code yourself.
